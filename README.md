# Personal Website (Version 4)

It's a tiny portfolio site, which was live between 2004 and 2011. It was hosted on a sub-domain at my former university (aspc.cs.utt.ro/~karg, then aspc.cs.upt.ro/~karg), managed by my former boss and teacher, Sorin Babii.

Has very bad HTML and no CSS. The avatar, is, however, a decent depiction of myself at that time (and one of the first attempts at pixel art).
